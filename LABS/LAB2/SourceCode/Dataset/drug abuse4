The long-lasting vulnerability to relapse remains the main challenge for the successful treatment of drug addiction. Neural systems that are involved in processing natural rewards and drugs of abuse overlap. However, neuroplasticity that is caused by drug exposure may be responsible for maladaptive, compulsive, and addictive behavior. The orexin (Orx) system participates in regulating numerous physiological processes, including energy metabolism, arousal, and feeding, and is recruited by drugs of abuse. The Orx system is differentially recruited by drugs and natural rewards. Specifically, we found that the Orx system is more engaged by drugs than by non-drugs, such as sweetened condensed milk (SCM) or a glucose saccharin solution (GSS), in an operant model of reward seeking. Although stimuli (S
