The emergence of negative affective symptoms during the course of alcohol use disorders (AUDs) (e.g. 'dark side' symptoms) has been suggested theoretically; however, the description of their occurrence is limited. This study operationalized two negative affect symptoms and tested the strength of association between these phenotypes and (1) indicators of the clinical course of the severity of AUD, (2) comorbid Axis I psychiatric disorders, suicidal behaviors and trait neuroticism and (3) whether participants reported drinking to relieve the negative affective symptoms.
