Early life trauma is strongly associated with an increased vulnerability to abuse illicit drugs and the impairment of neural development. This includes alterations to the development of the oxytocin system, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of social behaviours and emotion. Dysregulation of this important system also contributes to increased susceptibility to develop drug addiction. In this review, we provide an overview of the animal models of early life stress that are widely used, and discuss the impact that early life stress has on drug-taking behaviour in adolescence and adulthood in both sexes. We link this to the changes that early life stress has on the endogenous oxytocin system, and how exogenously administered oxytocin may help to re-establish functioning of the system, and in turn, reduce drug-taking behaviour.
