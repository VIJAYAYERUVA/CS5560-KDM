Heroin and methamphetamine (METH) addiction continues to be a major social, economic and therapeutic problem worldwide. The opioid pathway may mediate the effects of addictive drugs. However, the potential correlation between the κ1 opioid receptor (OPRK1) and drug addiction has not yet been characterized. The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential association between methylation of the OPRK1 promoter and substance abuse. Bisulfite pyrosequencing technology was used to determine the levels of OPRK1 promoter methylation in 60 drug abusers (30 heroin and 30 METH addicts) and 52 controls, observed to exhibit no significant differences in age or gender. The results indicated that levels of OPRK1 promoter methylation were significantly higher in drug addicts when compared with controls (P=2.43×10
