HIV/STI risk varies by sexual positioning practices; however, limited data have characterized the behavioral profiles of men who have sex with men (MSM) in France. This study used latent class analysis (LCA) to explore sexual risk profiles among MSM in Paris, France. LCA was used to classify sexual positioning and serosorting profiles among MSM in Paris (n = 496). Age, HIV status, relationship status, substance use, group sex, and PrEP history were used in a multinomial regression model predicting class membership. Three latent classes were identified: majority top/serosorters, versatile/low partners, and majority bottom/some serosorters. Majority top/serosorters had the highest probability of condomless serosorting; majority bottom/some serosorters had the highest mean number of partners (~ 12 partners) for condomless receptive anal intercourse. HIV-positive MSM were more likely to be classified as majority bottom/some serosorters than versatile/low partners (AOR 7.61; 95% CI 2.28, 25.3). Findings support the need for tailored and targeted interventions for highest-risk individuals.
