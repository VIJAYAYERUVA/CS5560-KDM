Objective Protracted drug withdrawal symptoms can last months or years after drug cessation, often precipitating a return to substance misuse. We evaluated the safety and preliminary health benefits of a unique chemical exposure regimen based on exercise, sauna and therapeutic nutrients. Methods This was a prospective evaluation of 109 individuals sequentially enrolled into a sauna detoxification component of a multi-modal, long-term residential substance abuse treatment centre. Results Data from medical charts, client self-reports and Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) responses indicated that the Hubbard sauna detoxification method was well tolerated, with a 99% completion rate, including one human immunodeficiency virus and nine hepatitis C positive clients. There were no cases of dehydration, overhydration or heat illness. Statistically significant improvements were seen in both mental and physical SF-36 scores at regimen completion, as well as in Addiction Severity Index and Global Appraisal of Individual Needs Short Screener change scores at rehabilitation program discharge, compared with enrolment. Conclusions The regimen lacked serious adverse events, had a very low discontinuation rate and high client-reported satisfaction. The SF-36 data indicated improved physical and emotional symptoms. Therefore, broader investigation of this sauna-based treatment regimen is warranted.
